# The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (Project Gutenburg)

This is a LaTeX learning project and is not meant to be an example of best practice or demonstration of how to typeset a book using LaTeX.

I hope to update it from time-to-time as my understanding of how to best layout a book like this in LaTeX matures and to fix any mistakes that I've made along the way.
